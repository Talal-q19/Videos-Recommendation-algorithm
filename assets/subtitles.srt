The king's prophecy was true.

363
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,446
He said that a great wizard
bearing the name of our land

364
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,658
will descend
from the heavens, and save us all.

365

And here you are.

366
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,495
Here to claim your throne.

368
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,666
You mean,
like a king's throne?

369
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,377
Well, yes. Because
you will be our king.

370
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,295
Your king?

371
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:32,674
Like, in a palace with
a crown and a scepter?

372
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:36,636
Yes, a beautiful scepter
and a grand palace.

373
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:39,472
Oh. And you will
save all the people.

374
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,183
Was that a gold scepter?

375
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,396
Yes, there's more gold
than you could ever imagine.

376
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:49,857
And Oz will now be
what it once was.

377
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:54,028
Because you are
the Wizard, aren't you?

378

1435
01:28:36,061 --> 01:28:37,937
The old wizard
could grant wishes.

1436
01:28:38,522 --> 01:28:39,522
Ah.

1437
01:28:39,606 --> 01:28:42,483
People would
travel to the Emerald City

1438
01:28:42,567 --> 01:28:44,402
and ask him for things.

1439
01:28:44,569 --> 01:28:48,030
And if they were
good and noble wishes,

1440
01:28:48,198 --> 01:28:49,407
he would grant them.

1441
01:28:49,574 --> 01:28:51,242
Is that right?

1442
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:54,036

Hmm. A pretty dress?

1444

I'm sorry.

1447

I can't grant wishes.

1448

I'm not that kind of wizard.

1449

That's what I thought.

1450
01:29:16,143 --> 01:29:20,938
Um, you see, where I come
from there aren't any real wizards.

1451

Although, there is one.

1452

1453
01:29:30,157 --> 01:29:34,493
The Wizard of Menlo Park.
A truly great man.

1454
01:29:34,661 --> 01:29:37,788
-Did he grant wishes?
-No.

1455
01:29:37,956 --> 01:29:41,625
But he could look into
the future and make it real.

1456
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:45,338
He created the electric light,
the phonograph.

1457
01:29:45,505 --> 01:29:49,133
He created a camera that
could take moving pictures.

1458
01:29:49,301 --> 01:29:50,676
Pictures that move?

1459
01:29:50,844 --> 01:29:52,636
Yeah. Can you imagine?

1460
01:29:52,804 --> 01:29:56,349
And all he had was a little
bit of wire and some glass.

1461
01:29:56,975 --> 01:30:01,270
With almost nothing,
he made the impossible real.

1462
01:30:01,438 --> 01:30:03,522

of wizard you are?

the wizard that you need.

For you,

1953
02:02:51,614 --> 02:02:55,993
a sight envied by all
and seen by none.

1954
02:02:56,161 --> 02:02:57,161
You'll be astounded

1955
02:02:57,245 --> 02:03:00,789
by what you find
behind the curtain.

1956
02:03:05,337 --> 02:03:07,546
Oh, my.

1957
02:03:07,756 --> 02:03:09,381
It's very tight in here.

1958
02:03:09,549 --> 02:03:11,175
It's nice, isn't it?

1959
02:03:12,552 --> 02:03:13,969
I know what
you're up to, Wizard.

1960
02:03:14,137 --> 02:03:17,222
What? I'm just
giving you a tour.

1961
02:03:17,724 --> 02:03:20,142
And I want to thank you.

1962
02:03:20,643 --> 02:03:22,895
For opening my eyes.

1963
02:03:23,063 --> 02:03:24,813
And what do you see?

1964
02:03:28,485 --> 02:03:30,903
That I have everything
I ever wanted.

1965
02:03:35,158 --> 02:03:38,535
For the record, I knew
you had it in you all along.

1966
02:03:40,163 --> 02:03:41,663
Greatness?

1967
02:03:41,915 --> 02:03:44,666
No. Better than that.

1968
02:03:45,335 --> 02:03:46,585
Goodness.

1969
02:04:06,940 --> 02:04:08,399
Now, Knuck.

1970
02:04:09,609 --> 02:04:10,943
(BLOWING FANFARE)

1971
02:04:15,532 --> 02:04:16,949

(RHYTHMIC POP SONG PLAYING)

1976
02:07:11,332 --> 02:07:14,126
l've seen the light
in the sky

1977
02:07:14,210 --> 02:07:16,962
ln the skies like fireflies

1978
02:07:17,046 --> 02:07:22,342
Burning bright,
just to vanish in the dark

1979
02:07:22,427 --> 02:07:25,053
l've held hope
in my two hands

1980
02:07:25,138 --> 02:07:27,889
That there would be
another chance

1981
02:07:27,974 --> 02:07:33,854
To find a kingdom
l believe in in my heart

1982
02:07:33,938 --> 02:07:38,984
'Cause underneath the good there's
something greater than you know

1983
02:07:39,068 --> 02:07:45,907
When you're almost there
And you're almost home

1984
02:07:46,451 --> 02:07:49,953
Just open up
your eyes and go, go

1985
02:07:50,038 --> 02:07:56,960
When you're almost there
Almost home

1986
02:07:57,545 --> 02:08:04,343
Know you're not alone
You're almost home

1987
02:08:12,060 --> 02:08:17,481
When you run, run so far
You've forgotten who you are

1988
02:08:17,690 --> 02:08:22,319
Where you're from
lt's like some other universe

1989
02:08:23,154 --> 02:08:25,697
You count your steps
Like they're regrets

1990
02:08:25,782 --> 02:08:28,533
You catch one breath
Then lose the rest

1991
02:08:28,618 --> 02:08:31,203
Wrong is right
Right is left

1992
02:08:31,287 --> 02:08:34,081
And there's nowhere
left to turn

1993
02:08:34,582 --> 02:08:39,711
So don't believe in everything you
think, you think you know

1994
02:08:39,796 --> 02:08:46,551
When you're almost there
And you're almost home

1995
02:08:47,011 --> 02:08:50,722
Just open up
your eyes and go, go

1996
02:08:50,807 --> 02:08:57,270
When you're almost there
Almost home

1997
02:08:58,189 --> 02:09:05,112
Know you're not alone
You're almost home

1998
02:09:12,829 --> 02:09:16,832
When you let
your heart be the compass

1999
02:09:18,543 --> 02:09:22,879
You won't get lost
Not if you trust it

2000
02:09:24,006 --> 02:09:28,593
When you hear
the sound of the trumpet

2001
02:09:28,845 --> 02:09:32,556
Louder than ever before

2002
02:09:34,767 --> 02:09:41,690
Oh, when you're almost there
Almost home

2003
02:09:42,358 --> 02:09:45,944
Just open up
your eyes and go, go

2004
02:09:46,028 --> 02:09:52,200
'Cause you're almost there
Almost home

2005
02:09:53,369 --> 02:10:00,167
Know you're not alone
You're almost home
